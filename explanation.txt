Things I did ex: (L100) for line 100:

A bunch of debugging print statements

last_sent_ and last_delivered_ and weird initializations where it would check the 2nd element of array (since we check last_sent + 1 and it starts at 0) so I initialized to -1 (constructor)

added a delivered_ field to keep track of what messages the process has delivered, then ready_to_deliver is set as delivered (to get past the circular problem of you waiting for me to deliver while I wait for you) (L297)

removed the check condition of next_to_deliver compared with last_acked_all since it was running into the problem for the first packet, last acked all is 0 and things ended up never getting delivered (L293)

copied code to the if condition checking if message is empty (L302) since index should still be incremented


It now sends 500 packets between 2 processes but there is a termination error as expected
